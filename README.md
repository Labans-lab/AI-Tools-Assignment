 **Part 1: Theoretical Questions**
**Q1: Differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch**

**Answer:**

TensorFlow: Excellent for production; supports TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving.

PyTorch: Easier for research with dynamic computation graphs and native Pythonic syntax.
-Choose TensorFlow for deployment; PyTorch for rapid experimentation.

**Q2: Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI**

Interactive coding & visualization during data exploration.

Model experimentation and documentation in one place.

**Q3: How spaCy Enhances NLP**

Provides pretrained pipelines for tokenization, POS tagging, and NER.

Far more efficient and accurate than raw Python string functions.

Easily integrates with ML pipelines.

**Comparative Analysis**
Feature	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Focus	Classical ML (regression, classification)	Deep Learning (neural networks)
Ease for Beginners	Very easy; minimal setup	Steeper learning curve
Community Support	Large, active	Very large and industry-backed

**Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)**
**Task 1 ‚Äì Classical ML with Scikit-learn**

Dataset: Iris Species
**Goal:** Predict flower species using Decision Tree Classifier.

**Key Steps:**

Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset

Split into train/test sets

Trained DecisionTreeClassifier

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall

Results:

Accuracy: 96%
Precision: 95%
Recall: 94%

**Task 2 ‚Äì Deep Learning with TensorFlow**

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Goal: Build a CNN to classify digits (0‚Äì9).

Architecture Overview:

Conv2D ‚Üí MaxPooling ‚Üí Flatten ‚Üí Dense ‚Üí Output

Activation: ReLU, Softmax

Optimizer: Adam

Results:

Test Accuracy: 98.7%


**Visualization:**

**Task 3 ‚Äì NLP with spaCy**

Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews
Goal: Extract product names (NER) and determine sentiment.

**Approach**

Used spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") for NER.

Rule-based sentiment: positive if words like ‚Äúgreat‚Äù, ‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù appear.

**Example Output:**

Text: "I love my new Samsung phone!"
Entities: [("Samsung", "ORG")]
Sentiment: Positive üòä

**Ethical Reflection**

AI models should be:

Fair: Avoid bias in datasets (e.g., balanced representation).

Transparent: Explain how predictions are made.

Sustainable: Support equitable and resource-efficient solutions.

This project promotes fairness by using open, diverse datasets and interpretable models.
