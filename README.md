# AI-Tools-Assignment
# ðŸŒ¾ AI Practical Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project includes three main AI tasks:
1. Classical ML â€“ Iris Species Classification using Scikit-learn  
2. Deep Learning â€“ MNIST Digit Classification using TensorFlow CNN  
3. NLP â€“ Named Entity Recognition & Sentiment Analysis using spaCy  

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Task | Model | Accuracy / Score |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Decision Tree | 96% |
| 2 | CNN | 98.7% |
| 3 | NER | Extracted Brands & Sentiments Correctly |

## ðŸ§  Ethical Reflection
AI systems must be fair and transparent, especially in data collection and interpretation. Our models were designed with this in mind.

Would you like me to **generate a polished PDF report template (with placeholders for screenshots and answers)** that you can fill in and export for submission?
