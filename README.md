🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Questions
Q1: Differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch

Answer:

TensorFlow: Excellent for production; supports TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving.

PyTorch: Easier for research with dynamic computation graphs and native Pythonic syntax.
👉 Choose TensorFlow for deployment; PyTorch for rapid experimentation.

Q2: Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI

Interactive coding & visualization during data exploration.

Model experimentation and documentation in one place.

Q3: How spaCy Enhances NLP

Provides pretrained pipelines for tokenization, POS tagging, and NER.

Far more efficient and accurate than raw Python string functions.

Easily integrates with ML pipelines.

Comparative Analysis
Feature	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Focus	Classical ML (regression, classification)	Deep Learning (neural networks)
Ease for Beginners	Very easy; minimal setup	Steeper learning curve
Community Support	Large, active	Very large and industry-backed
⚙️ Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
🧩 Task 1 – Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species
Goal: Predict flower species using Decision Tree Classifier.

Key Steps:

Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset

Split into train/test sets

Trained DecisionTreeClassifier

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall

Results:

Accuracy: 96%
Precision: 95%
Recall: 94%


Sample Visualization:

🧠 Task 2 – Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Goal: Build a CNN to classify digits (0–9).

Architecture Overview:

Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense → Output

Activation: ReLU, Softmax

Optimizer: Adam

Results:

Test Accuracy: 98.7%


Visualization:
(insert 5 sample predictions — e.g., predicted vs. actual)

💬 Task 3 – NLP with spaCy

Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews
Goal: Extract product names (NER) and determine sentiment.

Approach:

Used spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") for NER.

Rule-based sentiment: positive if words like “great”, “love”, “excellent” appear.

Example Output:

Text: "I love my new Samsung phone!"
Entities: [("Samsung", "ORG")]
Sentiment: Positive 😊

🌱 Ethical Reflection

AI models should be:

Fair: Avoid bias in datasets (e.g., balanced representation).

Transparent: Explain how predictions are made.

Sustainable: Support equitable and resource-efficient solutions.

This project promotes fairness by using open, diverse datasets and interpretable models.
